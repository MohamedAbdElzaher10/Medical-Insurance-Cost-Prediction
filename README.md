## Project Motivation

Accurately predicting health insurance costs is crucial for financial planning and risk assessment. This project aims to develop a predictive model that can estimate insurance costs based on various factors such as age, BMI, smoking status, and more.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Health Insurance Cost** dataset. It includes information about individuals' health and insurance costs. Key features include:

- `age`: The age of the individual.
- `bmi`: The Body Mass Index of the individual.
- `children`: The number of children/dependents covered by the insurance.
- `smoker`: Whether the individual is a smoker (yes/no).
- `region`: The region where the individual resides.
- `charges`: The insurance cost (target variable).

- **Number of Rows:** [Number of rows]
- **Number of Columns:** [Number of columns]

## Installation

To set up the project environment, install the necessary dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Key libraries used:
- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `xgboost`

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

An initial analysis was performed to understand the dataset and its characteristics:

- Checked for missing values and verified data completeness.
- Analyzed the distribution of the target variable and its relationship with other features.
- Visualized feature distributions and interactions using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

## Data Preprocessing

The following preprocessing steps were applied to prepare the data for modeling:

- **Handling Categorical Data:** Categorical features were encoded into numerical values.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created additional features to enhance the model's predictive power.
- **Train-Test Split:** The dataset was divided into training and testing sets for model evaluation.

## Modeling

Several machine learning models were evaluated for predicting insurance costs:

- **Random Forest Regressor**
- **Bagging Regressor**
- **Gradient Boosting Regressor**
- **Decision Tree Regressor**
- **XGBoost Regressor**

The best-performing models were selected based on their performance metrics.

## Model Evaluation

Model performance was assessed using the following metrics:

- **R-squared (RÂ²) Score**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**

Evaluation included cross-validation to ensure robustness and generalization.

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge: Handling Categorical Features
- **Description:** The dataset includes categorical features that need to be converted to numerical format.
- **Solution:** Used label encoding to transform categorical variables into numerical values.

### Challenge: Model Performance
- **Description:** Initial models showed suboptimal performance.
- **Solution:** Experimented with various machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter tuning to improve accuracy.

## Conclusion

The project successfully developed a predictive model for estimating health insurance costs. The selected models demonstrated strong performance, providing valuable insights into cost prediction.

## Future Work

- **Feature Expansion:** Investigate additional features or external data sources to enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Advanced Techniques:** Explore advanced machine learning methods or deep learning for improved performance.
- **Deployment:** Implement the model in a real-world application for practical use in insurance cost estimation.
